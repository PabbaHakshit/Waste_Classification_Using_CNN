To Develop a CNN Model To Classify Images Of Plastic Waste

This project focuses on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of plastic waste into distinct categories, facilitating automated waste segregation. The model leverages labeled datasets of plastic waste to learn visual patterns and characteristics for accurate classification. Key steps include dataset collection, preprocessing, model design, training, and evaluation. The outcome aims to support recycling initiatives and environmental sustainability by streamlining plastic waste management through AI-driven solutions.
